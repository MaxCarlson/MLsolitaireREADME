# ML Solitaire

ML Solitaire is a project designed to analyze and improve player retention and overall game performance within Solitaire. By leveraging data analysis, machine learning techniques, and modeling, this project provides insights into player behavior and game dynamics. The solution is modular, focusing on data processing, model training, and database management, while maintaining a scalable and reproducible development environment using Docker.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several key components:

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing player data to uncover trends and patterns. This includes profiling data to understand distribution, correlations, and possible outliers, setting the foundation for further insights and modeling.
  
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming raw game data into a structured format that can be used for machine learning tasks. This includes handling missing values, normalizing inputs, and preparing features that will be critical for the modelâ€™s success.

- **Modeling**: Applying machine learning algorithms to model player retention and other game-related metrics. The models aim to predict player behavior, optimize game features, and ultimately enhance game retention.

- **Database Management**: A PostgreSQL database stores the processed data and allows for efficient querying and analysis. This ensures that large-scale datasets can be easily accessed and analyzed throughout the project.

## Installation

To get started with ML Solitaire, follow these instructions to set up your environment:

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. If not, follow the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
  
- **Python**: Python is used throughout the project for data processing, analysis, and modeling. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and a suitable virtual environment tool like `venv` or `conda`.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MaxCarlson/mlsolitaire.git
    cd mlsolitaire
    ```

2. **Build the Docker Environment**:  
   The project uses Docker to ensure a consistent and reproducible environment. Run the following command to build and start the necessary services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. **Set Up the Environment**:  
   After building the Docker containers, you can initialize the environment by running the setup script:
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

### Additional Setup (Optional)

If you wish to manage Python dependencies locally or develop outside the Docker container, you can install the necessary Python packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect and load raw game data into the system.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, formatting data, and normalizing features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Profile the data to identify key insights, patterns, and potential outliers. This step helps guide feature engineering and model selection.

4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict player retention or other key game metrics. Experiment with various algorithms and evaluate performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or custom game-specific KPIs.

6. **Deploy and Analyze**: Once validated, the models can be deployed within the Dockerized
